/*
ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 6, brought several important features and enhancements to JavaScript. Some of the notable features introduced in ES6 include:

Arrow Functions: Arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for defining functions, making code cleaner and easier to read.

Block-Scoped Declarations: The introduction of let and const for declaring variables allowed for block-level scoping, reducing issues related to variable hoisting.

Template Literals: Template literals use backticks to create strings with embedded expressions, making string manipulation and concatenation more readable.

Enhanced Object Literals: Object literal syntax was improved, allowing shorthand property and method definitions, and computed property names.

Destructuring Assignment: Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays and objects into distinct variables, making code more concise.

Default Function Parameters: You can now set default values for function parameters, simplifying function argument handling.

Rest and Spread Operators: The ... syntax was introduced for rest parameters and spreading elements, providing flexibility with function arguments and array manipulation.

Classes: ES6 introduced class syntax for creating and inheriting from classes in a more structured and object-oriented way.

Modules: ES6 modules allow you to organize and encapsulate code in separate files, making it easier to manage dependencies and code structure.

Promises: Promises provide a more structured way to work with asynchronous operations, replacing callback hell.

Symbols: Symbols are a new primitive data type, allowing the creation of unique, non-enumerable object properties.

Generators: Generators are a special type of function that can be paused and resumed, useful for asynchronous operations and iteration control.

Maps and Sets: ES6 introduced new built-in data structures for handling key-value pairs (Map) and unique values (Set).

Iterators and Iterables: ES6 introduced the iteration protocol, allowing objects to define how they should be iterated using for...of loops.

Typed Arrays: Typed arrays provide a way to work with binary data, making it easier to interact with lower-level data types.

String Methods: ES6 introduced various string methods, such as startsWith(), endsWith(), includes(), and repeat().

Object.assign(): The Object.assign() method allows for object cloning and property merging.
