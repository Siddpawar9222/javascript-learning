//In JavaScript, an array can contain elements of different data types

/*
An array is a data structure that allows you to store and organize multiple values in a single variable. These values can be of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.

In JavaScript, arrays are technically objects. That's why when you use typeof on an array, it returns "object".
Arrays in JavaScript are special types of objects designed for storing ordered collections of data.
